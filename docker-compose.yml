# This docker-compose file creates one
# compose 'project' consisting of two containers
#
#  1. The PostgreSQL data  container
#  2. The LedgerSMB application container
#
# LedgerSMB persists all its data in the database,
# so no special care needs to be taken on
# container upgrades.  With PostgreSQL, data is
# persisted across upgrades by the use of a
# special 'dbdata' volume

version: "3.2"

  # Note that the container needs to be named "postgres" here,
  # because that allows us to use the default hostname ("postgres")
  # from the LedgerSMB configuration
