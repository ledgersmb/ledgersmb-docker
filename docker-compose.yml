# This docker-compose file creates one
# compose 'project' consisting of two containers
#
#  1. The PostgreSQL data  container
#  2. The LedgerSMB application container
#
# LedgerSMB persists all its data in the database,
# so no special care needs to be taken on
# container upgrades.  With PostgreSQL, data is
# persisted across upgrades by the use of a
# special 'dbdata' volume

  # Note that the container needs to be named "postgres" here,
  # because that allows us to use the default hostname ("postgres")
  # from the LedgerSMB configuration

      # its requests to this container. When this reverse proxy runs on the
      # Docker host, the default below applies. In case the reverse proxy is
      # hosted in a separate container, this setting needs to be adjusted.
